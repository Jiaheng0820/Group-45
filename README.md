# DB Indexing Experiment

This project contains a Python experiment comparing indexing strategies in MySQL and MongoDB.  
It measures execution time, **throughput, and storage consumption for four different indexing strategies:

1. MySQL Standard (single-field index)  
2. MySQL Optimized (composite index on multiple columns)  
3. MongoDB Standard (single-field index)  
4. MongoDB Optimized (compound index on multiple fields)
